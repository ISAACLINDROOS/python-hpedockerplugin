HPE 3PAR Share Plug-in For Docker: Create Help
===============================================
Create a share in HPE 3PAR using HPE 3PAR volume plug-in for Docker.

-o filePersona          Presence of this flag allows the File Persona driver to process the request
-o fpg=x                  x is the name of the file provisioning group (FPG). This option must be specified when user wants
                            to use a non-default FPG or a legacy FPG. The FPG may or may not be an existing one.
                            For a non-existing FPG x, a new FPG is created using the CPG that is either explicitly
                            specified with '-o cpg' option or configured in hpe.conf.
                            If FPG exists, be it a legacy FPG or Docker managed FPG, share is simply created under it.
                            In case this option is not specified, then a default FPG is created with size 64TiB if it
                            doesn't exist. Naming convention for default FPG is DockerFpg_n where n is an integer
                            starting from 0.
-o size=x                 x is the size of the share in MiB. By default, it is 1TiB
-o help -o filePersona    When used together, these options display this help content
-o help=backends -o filePersona  When used togther, these options display status of the backends configured for File Persona
-o fsOwner=x              x is the user id and group id that should own the root directory  of nfs file share in the form of
                            [userId:groupId]. Administartor also need to make sure that local user and local group with these
                            ids are present on 3PAR before trying to mount the created share.
                            For such shares which has userId and groupId specified, mount will succeed only if users and
                            group with specified ids are present on 3PAR.
-o fsMode=x               x is 1 to 4 octal degits that represent the file mode to be applied to the root directory of the
                            file system.
