HPE 3PAR Share Plug-in For Docker: Create Help
===============================================
Create a share in HPE 3PAR using HPE 3PAR volume plug-in for Docker.

-o filePersona          Presence of this flag allows the File Persona driver to process the request
-o fpg=x                  x is the name of the file provisioning group (FPG). This option must be specified when user wants
                            to use a non-default FPG or a legacy FPG. The FPG may or may not be an existing one.
                            For a non-existing FPG x, a new FPG is created using the CPG that is either explicitly
                            specified with '-o cpg' option or configured in hpe.conf.
                            If FPG exists, be it a legacy FPG or Docker managed FPG, share is simply created under it.
                            In case this option is not specified, then a default FPG is created with size 64TiB if it
                            doesn't exist. Naming convention for default FPG is DockerFpg_n where n is an integer
                            starting from 0.
-o size=x                 x is the size of the share in MiB. By default, it is 4TiB
-o help -o filePersona    When used together, these options display this help content
-o help=backends -o filePersona  When used togther, these options display status of the backends configured for File Persona
